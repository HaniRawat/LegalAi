# Problem It Solves

This project addresses the challenge of users seeking professional legal assistance but finding it difficult to navigate the complex legal landscape. Often, individuals and small businesses lack easy access to expert legal advice and relevant legal resources. Our platform uses AI to bridge this gap by providing personalized legal advice and directly connecting users to qualified lawyers based on their specific needs, without the need for lengthy searches or referrals.

# Project Features

- `AI-Powered Legal Assistance`: Leverages advanced AI models to provide legal recommendations and solutions based on case details, ensuring personalized and efficient support.
- `Lawyer Recommendation System`: Suggests the most suitable lawyers based on the user's location, case type, and preferences, connecting them with experts in specific legal fields.
- `PDF Support`: Enables the generation of legally formatted PDF documents with case summaries, recommendations, and legal advice, allowing users to easily save and share information.
- `Indian Subcontinent Focus`: Tailored for users in India and surrounding countries, providing localized legal recommendations, lawyer services, and resources specific to regional laws.
- `Auth0 Secured Authentication`: Ensures the highest level of security with Auth0-powered authentication, safeguarding users' sensitive data and personal information.
- `App + Web Options`: We have both a website for quick access and an app for both IOS and Android for best user experience.
- `User-Friendly Interface`: Designed with ease of use in mind, the platform offers a simple, intuitive experience that allows users to navigate effortlessly and access legal resources.
- `Case Summaries and Insights`: The platform enables users to provide case summaries and descriptions, allowing the AI and lawyers to generate relevant advice and support.

# Challenges we ran into

- `Connecting Users to Lawyers`: Integrating a reliable method to match users with lawyers based on their case details and location proved challenging. We had to ensure that the process was seamless and that users could access the correct lawyer without confusion.

- `Text Formatting in PDF Generation`: We faced difficulties formatting the AI-generated text correctly in PDFs, especially when the content was lengthy. Making sure that the text didn't spill over or cut off was a major hurdle.

- `Using Auth0`: We implemented the same Auth0 for both App and Website, it was a very big challenge initially but later we conquered it.
